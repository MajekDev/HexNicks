# HexNicks

HexNicks is a simple nickname plugin that allows players to set their nickname to anything they like containing normal
colors, hex colors, and even gradients! It fully supports **only** Paper, though forks should work as well.
There are only a few commands and permissions to limit what players use what commands. Though the plugin does have
support for MySQL storage, it's mostly intended to be a simple nickname plugin for smaller Spigot/Paper servers.

## Features

- Parsing via [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage) - here's a [handy website](https://webui.adventure.kyori.net/) to practice.
- Optimized support for Paper. Forks should work as well.
- [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) support with the placeholder `%hexnicks_nick%` for player's nicknames.
- MySQL storage support for users on BungeeCord/Velocity.
- Metrics through [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/HexNicks/8764).
- Active plugin and developer.
- Ability to format chat on it's own, no external chat formatter needed.
- Simple [api](https://hexnicks.majek.dev/developers) for developers.
- Full documentation [here](https://hexnicks.majek.dev).

## Support

If you need help with the plugin and can't find the answer here, then the best way to get help is to either join
my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz) or post in [discussions](https://github.com/MajekDev/HexNicks/discussions/categories/q-a).
If you join Discord make sure you read the frequently-asked channel before posting in the bug-reports channel
(if it's a bug)or in the hexnicks channel (for general help).

If you have discovered a bug you can either join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz) to tell me about it and then
open an issue here on GitHub. An open issue is the quickest way to get me to fix it. Please do not message me on Spigot i
n regard to a bug, there are easier ways to communicate.

If you've found a bug within the plugin and would like to just make the changes to fix it yourself, you're free to do
