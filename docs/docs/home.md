Welcome to the HexNicks docs!

HexNicks is a simple nickname plugin that allows players to set their nickname to anything they like containing normal 
colors, hex colors, and even gradients! It **only** fully supports the latest version of Paper (1.18.2+).
There are only a few commands and permissions to limit what players use what commands. Though the plugin does have support 
for MySQL storage, it's mostly intended to be a simple nickname plugin for smaller Paper servers.

This documentation is a constant work in progress so if you feel something is missing feel free to open an issue. 
The docs are organized into different pages for things like commands, permissions, etc. If you have questions the docs 
don't cover, please either post in [discussions](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/discussions) or 
join my [Discord](https://discord.majek.dev).

The HexNicks code lives on GitHub. If you have a bug report, or even a feature request, feel free to open an 
[issue](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/issues). The issues tab does not have to be just issues with the plugin, 
you are welcome to open an issue for an idea you have for improvement. There is also the 
[discussions](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/discussions) tab where you're welcome to post, please just follow the 
guidelines from this [post](https://github.com/Majekdor/HexNicks/discussions/28).
